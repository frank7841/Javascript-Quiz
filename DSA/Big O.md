# ðŸŒŸ BIG O Notation

Welcome to the world of Data Structures and Algorith
**What is a Data Structure?** It is a way to organise, store and access data
**What is an Algorith?** This is a step by step solution to a proble
**Why Data Structure?** **_To help you become a problem solver_**

## Lets dive in to the big 0

Big O notation helps us to understand **_How long_** an algorithim takes to run and **_How Much_** memory is needed as the amount to data input grows. i.e
**_Time_**and **_Space_** complexity.
